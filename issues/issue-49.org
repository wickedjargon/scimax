* First heading
Paragraphs can be collapsed with nbextention.
Test consecutive newcells, one of which is empty:
#+ipynb-newcell

#+ipynb-newcell
This should be a new md cell.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session

#+END_SRC

But this text after a src block is lost [BUG]
* Second heading
And the auto-numbering TOC extension works, too.

** A sub heading
Doesn't split with
*bold* anymore.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session
# there should be a markdown cell below this code block.
#+END_SRC

This is lost.
** Another heading
#+ipynb-newcell
Behaves as expected.
