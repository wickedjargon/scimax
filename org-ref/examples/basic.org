* Introduction <<sec-intro>>

This is a basic example. The section uses a target label. The next section (Sec. ref:sec-citations uses a =CUSTOM_ID=).

** Citations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-citations
:END:
index:citations

Here are a few typical
- cite :: [[cite:&kitchin-2015-examp-effec]]
- citeauthor ::  [[citeauthor:&kitchin-2015-examp-effec]]
- citenum ::  [[citenum:&kitchin-2015-examp-effec]]

index:label!table
#+name: tab-data
#+caption: some tabular data.
| x | y |
| 0 | 1 |


index:label!figure
#+name: fig-cos
#+caption: You need a caption.
[[./fig.png]]

Here is an equation using a latex label inside it.:

\begin{equation}\label{eq-int}
\int_0^1 e^x dx
\end{equation}


** cross-references <<sec-cr>>
index:cross-references

See section ref:sec-intro. The data is shown in Table ref:tab-data.

Here are some alternate kinds of refs.

- page :: Fig. ref:fig-cos is on page  pageref:fig-cos
- name :: nameref:fig-cos (uses the caption)
- equation :: Eq. eqref:eq-int

If you use [[https://ctan.org/pkg/cleveref?lang=en][cleveref]], these cross-references will be modified at compile time so they have a descriptor in front of each label:

- cref:sec-intro
- cref:tab-data
- cref:fig-cos
- cref:eq-int

These are capitalized versions.

- Cref:sec-intro
- Cref:tab-data
- Cref:fig-cos
- Cref:eq-int

You can also put several together  Cref:sec-intro,tab-data,fig-cos,eq-int

And for numerically sequential sequences, they will be collapsed when compiled to a range: cref:sec-cr,sec-misc,sec-citations. How this is done is customized in LaTeX, see the =cleveref= documentation.

** PDF

org-ref was designed for making PDFs via LaTeX. It should just work with a regular export mechanism. For this document your `org-latex-pdf-process' must run bibtex and makeindex.

[[elisp:(org-open-file (org-latex-export-to-pdf))]]

This document has many features that are not compatible with other formats (e.g. the list of tables, index, etc...). See [[./basic-csl.org]] for an example that works with other formats.
