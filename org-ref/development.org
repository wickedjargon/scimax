This document is mostly for me (John Kitchin) to document how to add features in a reasonable way to org-ref.

First make sure the repo is on master, and up to date.

Then, checkout a feature branch, e.g. here I am fixing issue #453 which is to add this document.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout -b issue-453
#+END_SRC

Or, in magit type: b c Ret <branchname>.

Make any changes you want in this branch and finally commit them.

Run the tests.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make mytest
#+END_SRC

If that passes you are probably good to either merge with master, or create a pull request.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout master
git merge issue-453
git push
#+END_SRC

If that goes ok, then delete the branch:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git branch -d issue-453
#+END_SRC
