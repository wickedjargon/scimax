* NEWS
** [2021-01-02 Sat] new features

It has been about two years since I noted the last new features. Here are few new features:

1. org-db - index your org-files into sqlite and then be able to search them
   1. scimax-contacts - an org-db add-on to help you find and use contacts
2. scimax-editmarks - a new markup for editing org-files and more.
3. scimax-@-links - use the @ key to easily insert a link from many different sources
4. scimax-hydra - a leader key like menu to use scimax

** <2018-02-28 Wed> scimax 2.0

It is an update of scimax, and the main new features are:

1. Major overhaul on ipython. See [[./scimax-ipython.org]].
2. A dashboard feature: [[./scimax-dashboard.el]]
3. A new inkscape link: [[./scimax-inkscape.el]]
4. You can put images on links with images in the description: [[./scimax-link-thumbnails.el]]
5. Functional text: [[./scimax-functional-text.el]]

And probably more.

* Installation

** Windows users

Install git (http://git-scm.com/download/win). Open a git bash terminal. Run this command.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkitchin/scimax/master/install-scimax-win.sh)"
#+END_SRC

There is an emacs 25.2 binary in this repository for Windows. You should be able to run the scimax.sh command to launch scimax now.

** Mac users

Run the next command in your terminal in the location you want to install scimax. The command will make sure you have [[http://brew.sh][homebrew]], git, and emacs installed, and then will clone scimax and tell you how to use it. It will take some time to install. You need to install your own Python and LaTeX. These days I am using [[https://www.continuum.io/downloads][Python3 from Continuum IO]] and MacTeX from http://www.tug.org/mactex.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkitchin/scimax/master/install-scimax-mac.sh)"
#+END_SRC

*** Alternative manual installation of scimax for Mac users

Alternatively, you can install [[http://brew.sh][homebrew]] yourself, install git from http://git-scm.com/download/mac, build your emacs like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install emacs --with-gnutls --with-imagemagick --with-librsvg --with-x11 --use-git-head --HEAD --with-cocoa
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, lately I have been using emacs-plus which claims to be faster for magit and has all those options enabled by default.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus
#+END_SRC

This got me:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :result org drawer :export results
(emacs-version)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: GNU Emacs 25.2.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin16.5.0, NS appkit-1504.82 Version 10.12.4 (Build 16E195))
:  of 2017-04-25



After that, I clone scimax like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax.git
#+END_SRC

and launch emacs with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
emacs -q -l scimax/init.el
#+END_SRC

** Linux users
Run this command. It checks for a git and emacs, but does not install them. You will have to use your package manager for that. You also need to install your own LaTeX and Python (and other languages you might want).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkitchin/scimax/master/install-scimax-linux.sh)"
#+END_SRC

** Manual installation

You can use your own emacs if you have one (version 25 or more is recommended). You still have to install Python and LaTeX if you will be using those.

Clone the scimax repo where you want it.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax.git
#+END_SRC

and launch emacs with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
emacs -q -l path/to/scimax/init.el
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, add scimax to your load path in your init file and just require what you want.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq scimax-dir "path/to/scimax")
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/scimax")
#+END_SRC

It is not uncommon to have to restart emacs a few times while all the packages from MELPA are installed. Windows seems to be like that.
