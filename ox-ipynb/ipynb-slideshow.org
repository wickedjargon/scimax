#+TITLE: An example ipynb slideshow from org-mode

* Custom cell metadata in Jupyter notebooks via org-mode
   :PROPERTIES:
   :metadata: (slideshow . ((slide_type . slide)))
   :END:

One feature of Jupyter notebooks that is sometimes used is custom cell metadata. This can, for example be used to put names on a cell, or tags for future analysis or conversion. One of the main uses is for annotating cells as part of a slide show. A cell can be a slide, subslide, fragment, note or skip.

ox-ipynb mostly supports this now. You can add metadata to a heading via properties or paragraphs via an attr_ipynb line or to a code block. The syntax is lispy, basically cons and list cells. These are read by emacs-lisp and converted to json at export time. Here is an example:


#+attr_ipynb:  (name . cell-range) (tags . (range print)) (slideshow . ((slide_type . slide)))
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[2]:
# output

:END:


#+attr_ipynb: (name . unique-cell) (tags . (tag1 tag2)) (slideshow . ((slide_type . slide)))
You can also use it to put a name and list of tags on a markdown cell.


#+attr_ipynb: (slideshow . ((slide_type . subslide)))
For convenience you can call =ox-ipynb-insert-slide= to insert the metadata on a paragraph or src-block. It will offer completion on the types of slides you can insert. This is a subslide.

#+attr_ipynb: (slideshow . ((slide_type . notes)))
This paragraph is just for notes. It won't show in the slide show.

#+attr_ipynb: (slideshow . ((slide_type . skip)))
No one should probably see this in the slide show.


#+attr_ipynb: (slideshow . ((slide_type . slide)))

** Export as slide show
   :PROPERTIES:
   :metadata: (slideshow . ((slide_type . slide)))
   :END:
There is a new export option =ox-ipynb-export-to-ipynb-slides-and-open=

*** Or if you like keybindings
   :PROPERTIES:
   :metadata: (slideshow . ((slide_type . fragment)))
   :END:
  C-c C-e n s.

/This was a slide fragment./

** You can have equations in your slides
   :PROPERTIES:
   :metadata: (slideshow . ((slide_type . slide)))
   :END:

A spiral is a parametric plot in $t$:

$x = \cos(t) e^{-a t}$

and

$y = \sin(t) e^{-a t}$

** You can put in code and figures in your slides
   :PROPERTIES:
   :metadata: (slideshow . ((slide_type . slide)))
   :END:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
import numpy as np
t = np.linspace(0, 8 * np.pi, 500)
x = np.cos(t) * np.exp(-0.1 * t)
y = np.sin(t) * np.exp(-0.1 * t)

%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x, y)
